*Contextual* makes it simple to write typesafe interpolated strings, checked at
compile time.

Contextual is a Scala library which allows you to define your own string
interpolators—prefixes for string literals which determine how they should be
interpreted—and to specify what should happen at runtime and compile-time,
writing very ordinary user code: no macros.
